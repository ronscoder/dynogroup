        <h3>Disclaimer Policy</h3>

    <hr>
    <p>
        A disclaimer may specify mutually-agreed and privately-arranged terms and conditions as part of a contract; or may specify
        warnings or expectations to the general public (or some other class of persons) in order to fulfill a duty of care
        owed to prevent unreasonable risk of harm or injury. Some disclaimers are intended to limit exposure to damages after
        harm or injury has already been suffered. Additionally, some kinds of disclaimers may represent a voluntary waiver
        of a right or obligation that may be owed to the disclaimant. Disclaimers vary in terms of their uniformity. Some
        may vary depending on the specific context and parties involved, while other types of disclaimers may strictly adhere
        to a uniform and established set of formalities that are rarely or never modified, except under official authority.
        Website disclaimer covers the following:
